For some time now, I've been intrigued by the scant recognition that videogames receive outside the ‘gamer’ realm. I don't believe this lack of recognition is due to deliberate disregard, but rather a shortage of information. To help appreciate the enormous effort involved in creating a videogame, I've devised an analogy with something much more tangible and physical.

In this post, we will compare the estimated hours of work required to develop a videogame with those historically invested in the construction of cathedrals, skyscrapers, and pyramids.

Both videogames and building constructions require multidisciplinary teams. A videogame is not just interaction: characters need to be designed, modeled, animated, and given a voice. There is also a need to tell a story, create scenarios, and dialogues, not to mention including sounds and a background soundtrack. To make everything fun and interactive, it is also necessary to design, program, and balance the mechanics. This gives us an initial idea of the different roles needed to create a videogame.

To illustrate this comparison, I have created a table —with the help of AI— where we can see the duration and estimated cost of some of the most emblematic videogames and buildings.
