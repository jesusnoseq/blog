## Purposes

* Learning what inflation is and how to obtain related data

## Inflation

As you may know from [this post](https://jesusnoseq.com/en/posts/investment/) inflation is not good for our fiat money.
Here a book definition
> Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.

In a simpler language:
> You can buy fewer things with the same amount of money. Decreases the value of money.

### It could be caused by

* Increase in the money supply. [Money printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation).
* Production costs. If the energy cost increases, that could affect other products that depend on electricity to be manufactured.
* Increase in aggregate demand. When there is more demand for a product than production, it could increase in price. We saw that with [graphic cards](https://www.pcworld.com/article/394292/a-perfect-storm-why-graphics-cards-cost-so-much-now.html)

## How to obtain data

* To access with a browser use [inflationtool](https://www.inflationtool.com/)
* If you want to access programmatically you could download reports and read them from [worldbank inflation data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG)
